# Diplomatik: SQL-Based APIs for Data Analytics and Transformations

## Introduction

Diplomatik is a lightweight and extensible service that adapts a universal set of data models and APIs to query a 
variety of data sources. 

### What is It?

Diplomatik's goal is to provide a unified set of APIs and data models that act as if you are directly querying the 
underlying database, data warehouse or data integrations, without having to worry about compatability and security 
issues. For example, the same APIs and data structures can be used to query a Postgres database and a columnar data 
warehouse, such as Big Query. No need to plumb in all the messy middleware logic, since Diplomatik handles that all for 
you.

### Motivation

While there are already excellent data source abstraction frameworks out, many are built for specific purposes or a 
specific audience. For example, [cube](https://github.com/cube-js/cube) is a fantastic semantic layer suited for data 
teams and focus on SQL based models that data engineers and analysts can build on.

In contrast, Diplomatik is focused on being developer-oriented, API-first, and extensible for custom scenarios. It 
excels in providing expressive data models that let clients and frontends feel as if they are directly 
querying the underlying datasources via APIs. Are you querying across different data sources or concerned with about 
database security and multi-tenancy issues? No worries, let Diplomatik handle that for you with the same set of APIs.
